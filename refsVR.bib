   abstract = {Shared space is an approach to improving streets and places where both pedestrians and vehicles are present, with layouts related more to the pedestrian scale and with features encouraging drivers to assume priority having been reduced or removed. It creates a more pedestrian-friendly environment than conventional street layouts, which are based on greater segregation between pedestrians and vehicles, while at the same time introducing uncertainty, which makes drivers engage more fully with their surroundings, leading to lower vehicle speeds and improved safety. This paper investigates the importance of certain person-, context- and design-specific factors affecting the perceptions of pedestrians and drivers to shared space. Using two web-based stated-preference surveys, two sets of responses are collected from pedestrians and drivers, who are presented with different combinations of binary factors forming scenarios. Regression analysis is carried out with logit models for each survey. The results suggest that pedestrians feel most comfortable in shared space under conditions which ensure their presence is clear to other road users - these conditions include low vehicular traffic, high pedestrian traffic, good lighting and pedestrian-only facilities. Conversely, the presence of many pedestrians and, in particular, children and elderly, makes drivers feel uneasy and, therefore, enhances their alertness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {<p>This paper reviews the concepts of immersion and presence in virtual environments (VEs). We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE Conference in London, UK.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>We describe an experiment to assess the influence of body movements on presence in a virtual environment. In the experiment 20 participants were to walk through a virtual field of trees and count the trees with diseased leaves. A 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used to assess the influence of two factors on presence: tree height variation and task complexity. The field with greater variation in tree height required participants to bend down and look up more than in the lower variation tree height field. In the higher complexity task participants were told to remember the distribution of diseased trees in the field as well as to count them. The results showed a significant positive association between reported presence and the amount of body movement - in particular, head yaw - and the extent to which participants bent down and stood up. There was also a strong interaction effect between task complexity and gender: Women in the morecomplex task reported a much lower sense of presence than in the simpler task. For applications in which presence is an important requirement, the research in this paper suggests that presence will be increased when interaction techniques are employed that permit the user to engage in whole-body movement.</p>},

   abstract = {Shared space is an approach to street design which minimises demarcations between vehicles and pedestrians. It has become particularly influential in the UK, where a comprehensive study of shared space schemes has informed recently published national guidance to local highway authorities. This paper critically examines the claim made in the guidance that it is ‘evidence based'. Primary research reported in the paper examines one of the sites in the ‘official study' in Ashford, Kent, in greater depth, using video observation and a street survey of pedestrians. The findings show that most pedestrians diverted away from their desire lines, gave way to vehicles in most cases and felt safer under the original road layout. This evidence, and the analysis of the ‘official study', cast doubt on some aspects of the methodology and its interpretation in the national guidance. The authors conclude that some of the claims made on behalf of shared space have overstated the available evidence, and that caution is needed in implementing shared space schemes, particularly in environments of high traffic flows.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to clearly establish the origin and evolution of the shared space concept from a New Zealand perspective by reviewing the literature in the disciplines of both urban design and transportation engineering. The review process involves investigating the use and function of a public road space in the context of the changing of public expectations and how this can relate to a number of interconnected street design approaches (e.g. traffic calming and self-explaining roads (SERs)). These approaches have been used to minimise the influence of motor vehicles since the beginning of the automobile era. The shared space concept, when applied in public road environments in activity centres, has increasingly been embraced by urban planners, transportation engineers and regulatory agencies. A shared space diverges from a conventional road where all road users are encouraged to legitimately occupy the same road space with little physical separation. To achieve this in a safe and efficient manner, the design aims to reduce the dominance of the motor vehicle by promoting pedestrian and cycling activity and utilising the road space as a 'place' in addition to its 'transport' mobility and access purposes. Given the fundamental conceptual differentiation between a traffic-calmed street and a shared space, the paper argues that there are certain design elements, constituting a shared space, and without them, it would be difficult for a public street to function as a genuine shared space for all road users. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

Shared space is a design feature that aims to encourage pedestrians, cyclists and drivers to share the same deregulated space. However, there is a lack of evidence underpinning shared space, in terms of attitudes and usability, particularly for vulnerable road users including blind and partially sighted, elderly and wheelchair users. This research used street accessibility audits and focus groups with vulnerable pedestrians and 100 completed on-street questionnaires to investigate attitudes and behaviour towards a shared space scheme in Hereford, UK. The findings have shown that despite being very positive towards the scheme, particularly in terms of aesthetics, pedestrians and vulnerable road users had a number of issues and concerns with the design and usability of Widemarsh Street, in particular with nuances of design including the kerbs and vehicular access to the street. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{DrettakisPresence2007,
   abstract = {In this paper we present a user-centered design approach to the development of a Virtual Environment (VE), by utilizing an iterative, user-informed process throughout the entire design and development cycle. A preliminary survey was first undertaken with end users, that is, architects, chief engineers, and decision makers of a real-world architectural and urban planning project, followed by a study of the traditional workflow employed. We then determined the elements required to make the VE useful in the real-world setting, choosing appropriate graphical and auditory techniques to develop audiovisual VEs with a high level of realism. Our user-centered design approach guided the development of an appropriate interface and an evaluation methodology to test the overall usability of the system. The VE was evaluated both in the laboratory and, most importantly, in the users' natural work environments. In this study we present the choices we made as part of the design and evaluation methodologies employed, which successfully combined research goals with those of a real-world project. Among other results, this evaluation suggests that involving users and designers from the beginning improves the effectiveness of the VE in the context of the real world urban planning project. Furthermore, it demonstrates that appropriate levels of realism, in particular spatialized 3D sound, high-detail vegetation, and shadows, as well as the presence of rendered crowds, are significant for the design process and for communicating about designs; they enable better appreciation of overall ambi-ence of the VE, perception of space and physical objects, as well as the sense of scale. We believe this study is of interest to VE researchers, designers, and practitioners , as well as professionals interested in using VR in their workplace.},

abstract = {Computer vision methods that quantify the perception of urban environment are increasingly being used to study the relationship between a city's physical appearance and the behavior and health of its residents. Yet, the throughput of current methods is too limited to quantify the perception of cities across the world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new crowdsourced dataset containing 110,988 images from 56 cities, and 1,170,000 pairwise comparisons provided by 81,630 online volunteers along six perceptual attributes: safe, lively, boring, wealthy, depressing, and beautiful. Using this data, we train a Siamese-like convolutional neural architecture, which learns from a joint classification and ranking loss, to predict human judgments of pairwise image comparisons. Our results show that crowdsourcing combined with neural networks can produce urban perception data at the global scale.},

abstract = {Global citizens get few moments to rethink streets and make decisions that will both serve the basic purposes of transportation and address urgent challenges like climate change, rising obesity, social isolation and conflict— all while expanding opportunities for general happiness throughout society. Such a pivotal moment is upon us, as autonomous vehicles represent a potentially disruptive technology that can re-make the city for good or for ill. City planners, policy makers and community residents have a unique, and immediate, opportunity to rethink their streets with purposeful and creative consideration about how this critical public good may best serve the public for generations to come. The next wave of transportation technology is coming quickly – the autonomous vehicle (AV) or driverless car. 1 This is the moment for all levels of government to revisit the fundamental purposes of transportation, to take stock of our transportation systems and policies, and attempt to do transportation better. In particular, autonomous vehicles present new and unique opportunities for fresh thinking about how streets are used – by whom, how, and to what ends. The bulk of transportation planning over the last half-century has conflated the basic purpose of transportation – providing access to destinations – with the simplistic goal of moving motor vehicles at high speeds with limited impedance. 2},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of the perception systems and simulators for autonomous vehicles (AV). This work has been divided into three parts. In the first part, perception systems are categorized as environment perception systems and positioning estimation systems. The paper presents the physical fundamentals, principle functioning, and electromagnetic spectrum used to operate the most common sensors used in perception systems (ultrasonic, RADAR, LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS, RTK, etc.). Furthermore, their strengths and weaknesses are shown, and the quantification of their features using spider charts will allow proper selection of different sensors depending on 11 features. In the second part, the main elements to be taken into account in the simulation of a perception system of an AV are presented. For this purpose, the paper describes simulators for model-based development, the main game engines that can be used for simulation, simulators from the robotics field, and lastly simulators used specifically for AV. Finally, the current state of regulations that are being applied in different countries around the world on issues concerning the implementation of autonomous vehicles is presented.},

@article{Gold2015,
abstract = {Highly automated vehicles (Level 3, [1]) are likely to enter the market within the next decade. By removing the driver from the driver-vehicle system, positive impacts, for instance on road-safety or fuel consumption, are expected. These predicted effects can only arise if automated vehicles are accepted by society. Trust as well as the attitude towards technology has been found to be a precursor in the acceptance formation process. Therefore, we conducted a driving simulator experiment within the interdisciplinary research group at the Munich Center of Technology in Society (MCTS) in order to investigate how the experience of automated driving will change trust in automation and the attitude of the driver towards automation. The sample consisted of 72 participants between 19 and 79 years (M = 44.97, SD = 22.16). Participants completed a questionnaire before and after the driving simulator experience to assess trust in automation, safety gain, intention to use and other constructs in order to analyze the change caused by the driving simulation experience. Besides participants' ratings from the questionnaires, their gaze behavior was recorded in order to measure a change of trust by a change in scanning behavior. The participants drove highly automated on a three lane highway at a speed of 120 km/h. As critical situations are expected to have a significant impact on trust in automation, the participants experienced three take-over scenarios (system limits). Results indicate that the driving experience increased self-reported trust in automation and lead to a decrease in other measured constructs like safety gain. Older participants rated the vehicle automation more positively than younger drivers. Horizontal gaze behavior could not be confirmed as a metric for measuring trust in automation, although this measure behaved as expected and analogous to the self-reported level of trust.},

abstract = {Partially and fully automated vehicles (AVs) are being developed and tested in different countries. These vehicles are being designed to reduce and ultimately eliminate the role of human drivers in the future. However, other road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists will still be present and would need to interact with these automated vehicles. Therefore, external communication interfaces could be added to the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and other non-automated road users. The first aim of this study is to investigate how the physical appearance of the AV and a mounted external human-machine interface (eHMI) affect pedestrians' crossing intention. The second aim is to assess the perceived realism of Virtual reality based on 360° videos for pedestrian crossing behavior for research purposes. The speed, time gap, and an eHMIs were included in the study as independent factors. Fifty-five individuals participated in our experiment. Their crossing intentions were recorded, as well as their trust in automation and perceived behavioral control. A mixed binomial logistic regression model was applied on the data for analysis. The results show that the presence of a zebra crossing and larger gap size between the pedestrian and the vehicle increase the pedestrian's intention to cross. In contrast to our expectations, participants intended to cross less often when the speed of the vehicle was lower. Despite that the vehicle type affected the perceived risk of the participants, no significant difference was found in crossing intention. Participants who recognized the vehicle as an AV had, overall, lower intentions to cross. A strong positive relationship was found between crossing intentions and perceived behavioral control. A difference in trust was found between participants who recognized the vehicle as automated, but this did not lead to a difference in crossing intentions. We assessed the research methodology using the presence questionnaire, the simulation sickness survey, and by comparing the results with previous literature. The method scored highly on the presence questionnaire and only 2 out of 55 participants stopped prematurely. Thus, the research methodology is useful for crossing behavior experiments.},

abstract = {Vehicles in developing countries have widely varying dimensions and speeds, and drivers tend to not follow lane discipline. In this flow state called “mixed traffic”, the interactions between drivers and the resulting maneuvers resemble more that of general disordered self-driven particle systems than that of the orderly lane-based traffic flow of industrialized countries. We propose a general multi particle model for such self-driven “high-speed particles” and show that it reproduces the observed characteristics of mixed traffic. The main idea is to generalize a conventional acceleration-based car-following model to a two-dimensional force field. For in-line following, the model reverts to the underlying car-following model, for very slow speeds, it reverts to an anisotropic social-force model for pedestrians. With additional floor fields at the position of lane markings, the model reverts to an integrated car-following and lane-changing model with continuous lateral dynamics including cooperative aspects such as zip merging. With an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system as underlying car-following model, it becomes a controller for the acceleration and steering of autonomous vehicles in mixed or lane-based traffic.},

@article{Ruiz-Apilanez2017,
abstract = {Shared space is becoming an increasingly well-accepted approach to street design, pursuing improvement of street uses on foot without restricting other modes of movement. This approach introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding application of traffic rules by minimising traffic signs and conventional physical demarcations to enable different users to share the road space and negotiate their movement through and across it. Despite existing evidence for reduced traffic accidents and casualties, this type of street design remains an unorthodox approach. This article addresses the key issues of road safety, user comfort and revitalization aspects of the shared space, raised in the last decade with a focus on pedestrian users. Based on analysis of the layout, performance and user perception of six study areas, evidence reveals how these schemes affect safety, comfort, the conventional spatial distribution or hierarchy of users, and public life.},

@article{Fagerland2009,
abstract = {The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is often used to compare the means or medians of two independent, possibly nonnormal distributions. For this problem, the true significance level of the large sample approximate version of the WMW test is known to be sensitive to differences in the shapes of the distributions. Based on a wide ranging simulation study, our paper shows that the problem of lack of robustness of this test is more serious than is thought to be the case. In particular, small differences in variances and moderate degrees of skewness can produce large deviations from the nominal type I error rate. This is further exacerbated when the two distributions have different degrees of skewness. Other rank-based methods like the Fligner-Policello (FP) test and the Brunner-Munzel (BM) test perform similarly, although the BM test is generally better. By considering the WMW test as a two-sample T test on ranks, we explain the results by noting some undesirable properties of the rank transformation. In practice, the ranked samples should be examined and found to sufficiently satisfy reasonable symmetry and variance homogeneity before the test results are interpreted.

abstract = {Nonparametric data from multi-factor experiments arise often in human-computer interaction (HCI). Examples may include error counts, Likert responses, and preference tallies. But because multiple factors are involved, common nonparametric tests (e.g., Friedman) are inadequate, as they are unable to examine interaction effects. While some statistical techniques exist to handle such data, these techniques are not widely available and are complex. To address these concerns, we present the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) for nonparametric factorial data analysis in HCI. The ART relies on a preprocessing step that "aligns" data before applying averaged ranks, after which point common ANOVA procedures can be used, making the ART accessible to anyone familiar with the F-test. Unlike most articles on the ART, which only address two factors, we generalize the ART to N factors. We also provide ARTool and ARTweb, desktop and Web-based programs for aligning and ranking data. Our re-examination of some published HCI results exhibits advantages of the ART. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

To investigate this question, we had observers look at omnidirectional panoramic scenes, composed of both landscape and fractal images, using a virtual reality viewer while their eye and head movements were tracked. We analyzed the spatial distribution of eye fixations and the distribution of saccade directions and the spatial distribution of head positions and the distribution of head shifts, as well as the relation between eye and head movements. The results show that, for landscape scenes, eye and head behavior best fit the allocentric frame defined by the scene horizon, especially when head tilt (i.e., head rotation around the view axis) is considered. For fractal scenes, which have an isotropic texture, eye and head movements were executed primarily along the cardinal directions in world coordinates. The results also show that eye and head movements are closely linked in space and time in a complementary way, with stimulus-driven eye movements predominantly leading the head movements. Our study is the first to systematically examine eye and head movements in a panoramic virtual reality environment, and the results demonstrate that a virtual reality environment constitutes a powerful and informative research alternative to traditional methods for investigating looking behavior.},

To address this issue, we designed two museum rooms in VR throughout which participants could physically walk (i.e., high immersive and interactive fidelity). Participants were instructed to memorize all room details, which each contained nine paintings and two stone sculptures. On a subsequent old/new recognition task, we examined to what extent shared associated context (i.e., spatial boundaries, ordinal proximity) and physically travelled distance between paintings facilitated recognition of paintings from the museum rooms. Participants more often correctly recognized a sequentially probed old painting when the directly preceding painting was encoded within the same room or in a proximal position, relative to those encoded across rooms or in a distal position. A novel finding was that sequentially probed paintings from the same room were also recognized better when the physically travelled spatial or temporal distance between the probed paintings was shorter, as compared with longer distances. Taken together, our results in highly immersive VR support the notion that spatiotemporal context facilitates recognition of associated event content.},

abstract = {During natural visual exploration, both head and eye movements can be used to redirect gaze to new points of interest. In order to better understand the role of head movements in this process, we recorded subjects' head orientations while they explored a set of natural images from five different categories using virtual reality head-mounted displays. While head movements are likely influenced by image content or image saliency, here we focus on their stereotyped patterns, which have a consistent relationship between the amplitude, duration, and peak velocity of movements. We find that most head movements occur along the cardinal directions, and furthermore, the head position and head velocity distributions are similar across image categories. Our results provide greater insight into the kinematics of head movements during visual exploration in virtual reality environments.},

@article{Kruskal1952,
abstract = {Given C samples, with ni observations in the ith sample, a test of the hypothesis that the samples are from the same population may be made by ranking the observations from from 1 to $\Sigma$n i (giving each observation in a group of ties the mean of the ranks tied for), finding the C sums of ranks, and computing a statistic H. Under the stated hypothesis, H is distributed approximately as $\chi$2(C – 1), unless the samples are too small, in which case special approximations or exact tables are provided. One of the most important applications of the test is in detecting differences among the population means.

@article{Benjamini2001,
abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},
